This is a code to display a map.

I learned from Leaflet JS - https://leafletjs.com/
Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 38 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.

I modified a code a bit which I added a Zoom Control. Also added red circle radius & marker(Coordinates: KLCC, KL - [3.15930580, 101.71320250])
